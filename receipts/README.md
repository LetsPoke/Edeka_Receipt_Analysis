# Receipts Folder

This folder holds the PDF files for the receipts you want to parse.

- **Do not commit** sensitive or personal PDFs if you prefer to keep your receipts private.
- The `read_receipt.py` script expects to find all `.pdf` files here.

Usage:
1. Place your receipt PDFs in this folder.
2. Run the `read_receipt.py` script from the repository root.
3. The script will parse each PDF and output structured data into a JSON file.
