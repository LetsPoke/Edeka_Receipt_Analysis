# Edeka Receipt Analysis

A small project that parses PDF supermarket receipts (from Edeka), extracts structured data, and analyzes shopping insights. The solution is written in **Python** and uses [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) for text extraction.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**  
  Extracts text from receipts and converts them into structured JSON.
    - Identifies each item, including quantity, unit price, and total price.
    - Handles special cases like coupons, deposits (Pfand), and weight-based items (kg price).

- **JSON to CSV Conversion**  
  Converts the parsed JSON data into a CSV file for easier handling in Excel, Google Sheets, or further data analysis tools.

- **Data Analysis**  
  Performs aggregations and summaries (daily spend, items purchased, top items, etc.) using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Edeka_Receipt_Analysis.git
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place your PDF receipts** in the `receipts/pdfs/` folder.
2. **Parse receipts** into JSON:
   ```
   python scripts/read_receipt.py
   ```
    - The output file (`parsed_receipts.json`) will be generated in the `output/autogenerated/` folder.
3. **Convert JSON** to CSV:
   ```
   python scripts/convert_receipt.py
   ```
    - The resulting CSV (`parsed_receipts.csv`) will be created.
4. **Analyze**:
   ```
   python scripts/analysis/run_analysis.py
   ```
    - Prints various summary statistics and aggregations to the console.
    - The output is also saved in the `output/autogenerated/` folder.
